Block probes for Icestudio => Sigrok integration  (with Pulseview GUI)

This blocks provide the ability of debug signals inside your FPGA design without the need of external logic analycer.

Each probe permits analyce a number of signals and triggers it on up or down edge.

This is a working progress repository.
